Overall a clear presentation with good structure. Nice to visiulize the data in 2D to see the how those features can explain the data. Since the problem desciption hinted about univariant histograms of the features it would be nice to see a few of those as well. Here you only give an example of how two features can differentiate one of the classes. With the histograms you could visaulize all the 5 features and how they explain the data. Good that you explain that the noise is gaussian.

Would have been nice to see non-gaussian noise (uniform or log-normal) and the effects of that compared to gaussian.

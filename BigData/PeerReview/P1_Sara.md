# Peer review project 1 - Sara Nordin HÃ¤llgren

Overall a good structure and clear presentation. The different classifiers are clearly presented as well as the strategy. Might been nice to have a list of the datasets presented in the begining as well (or just summarized somewhere).

## Iris
  - Good presentation with the accuracy score and the accuracy as a function of "k" for kNN
  - Nice to have the exact syntax for the models if recreation of the test is wanted
  - Very nice and clean plots of the desicion boundaries

## Digits
  - Good description of the dataset as well as presenting that the features are strongly correlated
  - Hard dataset to visualize, but a nice try
  - Nice to add another image dataset to test QDA, as you say it only "implies" this assumption

## Wine
  - Good to recognize that the reason kNN performs poorly is the lack of data (as it is more data-driven than the others)
  - As well as no clear "island" of data in the middle
  - Don't know enough about random forrest yet to comment on that slide

## Vowel recognition
- As you say by the structure of the plot the dataset is very difficult to classify with feature 1 and 2

<p>Overall a good structure and clear presentation. The different classifiers are clearly presented as well as the strategy. I really like that you summarize your datasets on one slide for an easy overview. You also explain the different features and structures of the datasets.</p>
<p>Good explanation of the setup, or method of testing the classifiers. Good to mention that the datasets were normalized.</p>
<h2 id="fish-dataset">Fish dataset</h2>
<ul>
<li>A bit hard to read the numbers in the confusion matrix, but otherwise nice and clear illustrations.</li>
<li>Good that you bring up the multi-dimensional decision boundaries</li>
<li>Don't know too much about Random Forrest, but even though kNN is heavily data-driven the results indicate that RF is even more dependent on large amount of data. An additional parametric model would have been nice to compare against these two (LDA/QDA).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wine-dataset">Wine dataset</h2>
<ul>
<li>As before a good overview of the results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some good thoughts based on the testing</li>
<li>Again would have been nice with a classifier that assumes a distribution to see if that performs better on datasets with &quot;little&quot; data (fish dataset)</li>
</ul>

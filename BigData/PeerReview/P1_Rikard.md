# Peer review project 1 - Rikard Eriksson

Overall a good structure and clear presentation. The different classifiers are clearly presented as well as the strategy. I really like that you summarize your datasets on one slide for an easy overview. You also explain the different features and structures of the datasets.

Good explanation of the setup, or method of testing the classifiers. Good to mention that the datasets were normalized.

## Fish dataset
- A bit hard to read the numbers in the confusion matrix, but otherwise nice and clear illustrations.
- Good that you bring up the multi-dimensional decision boundaries
- Don't know too much about Random Forrest, but even though kNN is heavily data-driven the results indicate that RF is even more dependent on large amount of data. An additional parametric model would have been nice to compare against these two (LDA/QDA).

## Wine dataset
- As before a good overview of the results

## Conclusions
- Some good thoughts based on the testing
- Again would have been nice with a classifier that assumes a distribution to see if that performs better on datasets with "little" data (fish dataset)

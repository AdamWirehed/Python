<p>Overall a good structure and clear presentation. The different classifiers are clearly presented as well as the strategy. Might been nice to have a list of the datasets presented in the begining as well (or just summarized somewhere).</p>
<h2 id="iris">Iris</h2>
<ul>
<li>Good presentation with the accuracy score and the accuracy as a function of &quot;k&quot; for kNN</li>
<li>Nice to have the exact syntax for the models if recreation of the test is wanted</li>
<li>Very nice and clean plots of the desicion boundaries</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digits">Digits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Good description of the dataset as well as presenting that the features are strongly correlated</li>
<li>Hard dataset to visualize, but a nice try</li>
<li>Nice to add another image dataset to test QDA, as you say it only &quot;implies&quot; this assumption</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wine">Wine</h2>
<ul>
<li>Good to recognize that the reason kNN performs poorly is the lack of data (as it is more data-driven than the others)</li>
<li>As well as no clear &quot;island&quot; of data in the middle</li>
<li>Don't know enough about random forrest yet to comment on that slide</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vowel-recognition">Vowel recognition</h2>
<ul>
<li>As you say by the structure of the plot the dataset is very difficult to classify with feature 1 and 2</li>
</ul>

# Peer Review P2 MVE440

Overall a good and clear presentation. Nice to include the method in the begining to explain the workflow. Really nice to see a quick explenation of the clustering algorithms. 

Good visualization of how the features explains the data. Both in 2D scatter plot and (what I assume is) PDF of the feature values. You could include the y-axis and have a bit better structure of the placements of the figures.

Good explenation of how the data is generated. Nice to include parameter values and that you present that the data was standardized.

Good plot of the results. Maybe a quick explenation of the score-metric would be nice(ground truth needed or not) but otherwise good.

A really good discussion slide. Nothing to add there.
